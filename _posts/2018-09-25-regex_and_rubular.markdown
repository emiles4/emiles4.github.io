I recently completed the REGEX lab, and I had a lot of fun playing with the Rubular expression tester/editor. I have always been curious abou the code that lives behind functions like email verification and phone number verification. 

I watched a lab walkthrough that went a little further into the uses and methods for regular expressions, and the puzzle-like challenges where I could go from a blinking cursor to (?<=\.) {2,}(?=[A-Z]) and actually understand it was incredibly satisfying.

A Regular Expression (regex or regexp) is a tool that can be used in almost all programming languages,with a few tweaks. They are used to extract information from text (strings of data) by defining search criteria in a pattern. Each character in the pattern is a sort-of wildcard that when used together helps save a programmer a lot of time. For example, a regex can be used to find and replace text in a document, validate data, or to scrape data for a certain set of words.

Medium.com has a great article with a cheatsheet that I found really helpful in breaking down the types of topics that can be used, such as Anchors, Quantifiers and Character Classes. <a href="https://medium.com/factory-mind/regex-tutorial-a-simple-cheatsheet-by-examples-649dc1c3f285"> Medium Regex Tutorial </a>

Tools like Rubular and RegExr are fun to mess around with, and awesome resources for quick reference guides for the syntax of a regex.
