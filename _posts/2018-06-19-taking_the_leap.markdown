I should have been a developer years ago. I grew up in the Silicon Valley, and worked for a software start up as my first job at 14. At that time, coding seemed unattainable, and so I stayed firmly in the tech-related or tech- adjacent jobs. Social Media Marketing, Project Management, and then I thought I would try something different and I have been a project manager for a Lighting Sales company for the last 4 years. 

Lighting is, surprisingly, really interesting. It has been fun to find success in this role - challenging myself to learn as much as I can about the industry and the products. Throughout my time with the company though, I just couldn't help myself ...I had to completely redesign our website from the ground up. And find a sample inventory program that was scalable and that had qr codes that could be scanned on mobile devices. Then I helped to automate our customer email program...etc. etc. I love tech, it is in my blood, and it is time to stop fighting it and just take the leap.
