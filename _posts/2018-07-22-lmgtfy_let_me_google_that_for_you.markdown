In the process of learning to think like a developer, one of the biggest challenges has been allowing myself to Google a problem. Which is strange, because I am the ultimate Googler - I can find anything and anyone using my trusty friend Google - to the point that, to some people, I am not Emily, I am Googly.

But when learning to code, Googling feels like cheating. Or like a shortcut that means I am not *really* learning the material. For the longest time I would fight the urge to do a search for a solution to a coding problem. I would go back over the material provided, try different things within my code, read the error messages. Going to a new tab and opening Google felt like failure. 

Sometimes though, you are just stuck, and Google is the answer. 
What I have come to understand, is that unless you post in some forum for someone to solve your code issue, searching for resources is not cheating, it is just using your resources.

I have learned so much while reading through other peoples coding problems. Though often there are large portions that I have yet to learn, in context, I understand the overall goal and how the solutions suggested can work. It is also really helpful to see that there are many different ways to approach a solution. It reminds me of cooking - different styles, flavors, and methods of cooking - but they all work.
